🌑 Part 1 — “The Desync”

You’re the son of the village chief — not royalty or anything, just the kid everyone expects to take over someday because you’re capable, not chosen.

Life’s chill… until it gets absolutely speed-run-ruined.

Bandits hit the village like they’ve been grinding intimidation skill points all week. Houses burning, villagers screaming, that whole “oh great, my comfort zone is on fire” starter pack.

Your dad — the chief — does the whole heroic-parent thing. Grabs you by the shoulders, eyes full of stubborn love:

“Get them out. Save who you can. I’ll handle the rest.”

Except “the rest” turns out to be a bandit boss built like he invested every stat point into ‘violence.’

You rush villagers to safety, then circle back (because plot armor hasn’t kicked in yet and you actually care). You face the bandits — shaky but determined — and somehow you scrap your way through most of them.
Even take a few down with some raw “I refuse to die here” energy.

But the boss?
Yeah… he two-shots you like you’re still level 1.

You hit the ground, bleeding out, vision tunneling… and right when everything starts fading to grayscale…

BOOM.

A black light — literally a cosmic software update — crashes down from the sky.
Silent. Heavy. Cold.

The world freezes for a millisecond.
Not magic. Not divine intervention.
Reality itself stutters… like the universe buffer-overflows around you.

Then that metallic voice slithers into your mind:

“NOX System initializing…
User detected…
Syncing soul file…”

Your wounds stop burning.
Your heartbeat restarts like someone pressed CTRL+Z on death.
A dark interface flicks open in the corner of your vision.

You didn’t survive the bandit boss.
You desynced —
and NOX synced you back.
